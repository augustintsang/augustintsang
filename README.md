## Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I'm Augustin, a junior at Berkeley. I'm pursuing a double major in Computer Science & Data Science whilst obtaining the Certificate in Technology & Entrepreneurship.

🔭I aspire to be using AI/ML to deeply understand global macroeconomic trends with commodity market fundamentals and building tools with the objective to facilitate international exchanges of goods, services and information.

💬I'm always up for a chat about football, cooking or anything you would like to share! Check out my website at [augustin.codes](augustin.codes) or reach out to me at [augustin.tsang@berkeley.edu](mailto:augustin.tsang@berkeley.edu)
